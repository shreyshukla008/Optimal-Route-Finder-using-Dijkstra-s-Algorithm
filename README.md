# Optimal-Route-Finder-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
I developed an optimal route finder application using Dijkstra's algorithm, implemented in C++. This application is designed to manage multiple modes of transport (such as cab, metro, and bus) and can optimize routes based on various criteria, including time and cost.

Key Features:
Multi-Mode Transport Management: The application can handle different transportation modes, assigning distinct time and cost parameters for each.
Multiple Criteria Optimization: Users can choose to optimize their route based on either time or cost.
Interactive User Input: The program prompts users to input their source and destination locations, and the criterion for optimization.
Detailed Route Display: After computing the optimal route, the program displays the route, including the transport modes used between each segment.

The program will prompt you to input:

Source location
Destination location
Criterion for optimization (time or cost)
Time per km for each mode of transport
Cost per km for each mode of transport

Requirements
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
Standard Template Library (STL)
